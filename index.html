        <p>
          With a Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering and 3 years of
          experience developing software solutions, I believe I have the right
          skills and qualifications for a junior role. My expertise lies in
          Java, HTML, CSS, Flutter, JS & Python . In my previous experiences, I
          have designed and built applications from scratch that are mentioned
          in my porfolio tab. I have also worked with a wide range of clientele,
          giving me great insight into their needs and providing me with
          valuable customer service experience. I am confident that I can
          contribute to your team's success with my creative problem-solving
          abilities and dedication to delivering high quality work on time. My
          CV/resume is attached for your review. Thank you for taking the time

          Football App
          <li>Live Scores and Match Details</li>
          The application uses an API to get live scores and match details of
          various football leagues and competitions. Users can view information
          about the teams, the players, the goals, and other relevant
          information related to the match.
          <li>Statistics and Analytics</li>
          The application provide users with statistics and analytics about
          players and teams, including performance metrics, rankings, and
          historical data. The application utlises Java to analyze data from the
          API and present it in a meaningful way to the user.

          Snake App
          <li>Game Board</li>
          The game board is a square grid which the snake moves inside using a
          2D array of cells, where each cell is either empty or occupied by a
          part of the snake's body or an apple.
          <li>Snake</li>
          Snake would be made up of a series of blocks that move around the game
          board. The player would control the movement of the snake using arrow
          keys or other controls
          <li>Apples</li>
          Apples would appear randomly on the game board. When the snake eats an
          apple, it grows longer and the player scores points.
          <li>Game Over</li>
          The game would end if the snake collides with a wall or with its own
          body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tic-Tac-Toe App
          <li>Game Board</li>
          The game would feature a 3x3 grid representing the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
          This could be implemented using a 2D array or a collection of objects
          representing each cell.
          <li>Player Turns</li>
          Game would alternate between two players, represented as "X" and "O."
          Each player would take turns selecting an empty cell on the board to
          place their marker.
          <li>Results</li>
          Win Condidition - win can occur if a player has three of their markers
          in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. If a win condition is
          met, the game would declare the winner and end the game. Tie - If all
          cells on the board are filled and no player has won, the game would be
          declared a tie.
          <li>Restart</li>
          After a game ends, the players could have the option to restart and
          play another round without relaunching the program.

          The application allows for users who want to buy and sell things via

          <li>Search Tool</li>
          The application provide users with sa tool to search for
          products/items that they may want or need or they can scroll throuh
          various categories to see other products also.

          <li>Games</li>
          Guess the image and match it to the corresponding image. Green if
          correct and red if wrong. Read it and say it - users will have a promt
          and will need to attempt to say the phrase before being promted if
          incorrect. Memory Test - 3 phases will appear and users will need to
          attempt to get all 3 correct for it to go green and red indicting that
          it is wrong.
          <li>Highscore</li>
          Other students can see where they rank among their peers using this
          highscore as a table to check how they progress.

                  <p>
                    I have developed a snake game using Java that is similar to
                    the retro game that has already been released. Now, I am
                    exploring ways to add additional features to enhance the
                    game experience.
